/**
 *Clockmaster
 *
 *Clockmaster only spawns at the very end of the caves away mission on the 4th floor. He, along with a recently converted following of miners, are attempting to resurrect the once
 *long forgotten Rat-Var from his ashen resting place. Keeps some distance from the player and shoots a projectile that pierces armor. Has a pre-battle monologue with nearby
 *players before the fight actually begins. Cultists present during this fight take additional damage from all of his attacks but also deal more damage. If a cultist is present
 *during the first dialogue interaction, he will remark about this but not give away who the cultist actually is.
 *
 *He has 2 phases, each with their own unique attacks (located in phase_one_attacks.dm and phase_two_attacks.dm respectively)
 *
 *PHASE ONE:
 *Raise Ocular Warden - Summons 4 ocular warden turrets at predefined locations, dealing cold damage. The clockmaster shoots a projectile that deals bonus damage to people who
 *are suffering from extreme temperatures in either direction. Can trigger ability again to replenish lost turrets even if ones are still active.
 *
 *Steam Vent Trap - Activates the vents scattered around the arena, blowing scorching steam out of them. Running into these vests while active throws you in a random direction and
 *causes burn damage. Will disable after 30 seconds.
 *
 *Cogscarab Swarm - Summons 4 cogscarabs to act as trash mobs to draw attention off him. Can have up to 8 cogscarabs at a time.
 *
 *When Clockmaster gets to half health on his first phase, he will trigger a mid-combat dialogue where he summons shields around himself and destroys any active clockwork mobs.
 *All nearby players are stunned for the duration of the dialogue as he spawns in the phase two version of himself.
 *
 *PHASE TWO:
 *Sevtug's Wrath - Summons a square around him and stops moving, if a player is caught in this square after 4 seconds they are thrown back and take toxin/brain damage, as well as
 *given 30 seconds of hallucinations. The boss takes half damage during this attack since he cannot move or use other abilities during it.
 *
 *Nzcrentr's Retribution - Marks a random nearby player as a target and draws a beam between them to distinguish who was chosen. The boss then will rapidly charge towards the
 *victim in a straight line trying to hit them. If he hits, throw the player back and cause major brute damage. Can miss the target since he aims for the floor below the mob
 *instead of the mob itself.
 *
 *Inath-Neq's Undying Legion - Summons 8 clockwork marauders in the corners of the arena and places a shield around themselves. The shield will not go down until all marauders
 *are fully dead. Deadlier version of cogscarab swarm. Cannot use other abilities during this attack.
 *
 *Steam Vent Trap - Same as the first phase's ability.
 *
 *Difficulty: Medium-Hard (advised to bring a couple friends or your own deathsquad suit)
 *
 *SHITCODE AHEAD. YOU WERE WARNED.
